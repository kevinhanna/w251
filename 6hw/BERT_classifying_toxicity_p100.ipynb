    "The original implementation of BERT is optimised for TPU. Google released some amazing performance improvements on TPU over GPU, for example, see [here](https://medium.com/@ranko.mosic/googles-bert-nlp-5b2bb1236d78) - *BERT relies on massive compute for pre-training ( 4 days on 4 to 16 Cloud TPUs; pre-training on 8 GPUs would take 40â€“70 days).*. In response, Nvidia released [apex](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/apex-pytorch-easy-mixed-precision-training/), which gave mixed precision training. Weights are stored in float32 format, but calculations, like forward and backward propagation happen in float16 - this allows these calculations to be made with a [4X speed up](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/issues/149).  \n",
    "\n",
    "We shall apply BERT to the problem for classifiying toxicity, using apex from Nvidia. We shall compare the impact of hardware by running the model on a V100 and P100 and comparing the speed and accuracy in both cases.   \n",
